# Gradient-Descent-In-Python
Implementation of Gradient Descent in Python from Scratch


Used sklearn's CALIFORNIA HOUSING DATASET to train a linear regression model

Implementation of gradient descent using numpy from zero.

Have stated OLSM regression in the first part of the code.

In the second part the implementation is done using multiple linear regression.

In the Third part the implementation is done using gradient descent

The error is caculated using MEAN SQUARED ERROR - MSE

OLSM MSE: 0.5485962279736201


MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MSE : 0.46636186533484425


GRADIENT DESCENT MSE : 0.6063931519838239
